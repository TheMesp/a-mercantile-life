~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
HOW TO READ THIS FILE:
Each event starts and ends with START and END.
The rough formatting is as follows (START and END
placed in brackets to avoid the program accidentally
reading this)
(the START word)
Event Type
Event Title
Event Description (can be multiple lines)
(The following fields are optional and can be omitted)
-Decision Title	
	#This decision will only be visible if this condition is true (there can be several of these)
	>Future Events Created by this decision>Months until the future event occurs
		(the future events can be seperated with the & symbol: in this case,
		the program will randomly choose one of the events listed.)
	Variables that are modified by this decision
-(additional decisions if required)
(the END word)

If an event has no decisions or no visible decisions, then the code will generate a generic
decision that will show as "1: Continue..." that has no effect. Essentially, the event is
just informative and has no immediate effect.

Only events with the type RandomEvent can be chosen randomly. All other events are generated
either directly in the code or are events that spawn from decisions. I try to keep child events nearby
their parent RandomEvent that can create them, if that makes sense.
CITY REFERENCE:
Cities are represented in the game CODE by a number (in gameplay, this is translated to the actual name).
The following number mapping is used:
0: Pisa
1: Genoa
2: Ferarra
3: Kaffa
4: Naples
5: Barcelona
6: Lubeck

VARIABLE GLOSSARY:
Plan	Special variable that decides whether to open the planning screen. Only used in YearlyEvents.
Cash	Amount of immediate cash.
IndCash	Amount of indirect cash via Bills of Exchange or other means.
City	A number representing the currently inhabited city.
SWares	Stands for "Specific Wares". After the event is calculated, the number in SWares is transferred
	to the ware that matches your current city.
0Wares	Current stock of wares in city 0 (Pisa). Similar for 1Wares through to 6Wares.
RWares	Special number that either grants or removes completely random wares.
	Adding random wares always adds the number.
	Removing random wares will try to reach the given number (since we don't want the code to crash
	trying to remove wares that aren't even there!)
TWares	Stands for "Total Wares" and is only used for checks. Represents the total stock of the player's wares.
0Rep...6Rep, SRep	Exact same concept as the "Wares" variables, but for Reputation.
CRep	Stands for "City Reputation". Always holds the current repuation of the city, and is used for checks.
Guelph/Ghibelline	Either 0 if not in a Guelph/Ghibelline city or 1 if in.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
These first two events are special events, created at the start of each year.
The first event only appears once, is the first event to occur, and forces you
to begin the planning interface. The second event that occurs every subsequent
January gives you a choice to just immediately remain and build reputation if
you want to save time by skipping the planning interface.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
START
YearlyEvent
Opening Moves
Shortly after inheriting your fathers money and wares, you
see it fit to use these assets to lay groundwork for a
successful mercantile career.

YearlyEvent
The Start of Another Year
The sun rises on the beginning of another year. It is now

	Plan = 1
-Skip Planning
	Plan = 0
	SRep = 10
END

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
These events are mainly to make use of the Guelph/Ghibelline situation. You can decide whether
to pay taxes in exchange for reputation or move to a location where you will not be taxed.

Birth of a new Religious Tax
Evidently the Pope is currently strapped for funds, as you have recieved word of a religious tax that
will be implemented soon into the future. The tax will consist of 100 cash, or barring that, a large
seizure of assets. You should be able to avoid the tax by moving to a non-Guelph city, but remaining in
a Guelph city and paying the tax may also raise your reputation...

You somehow manage to convince the Podesta that you have no obligation to pay the tax.
You are left to continue your business, but nobody is particularly pleased with you.

END
START
Event
Well, That Didn't Work
The Podesta is thoroughly unimpressed by your efforts to squeeze out of the tax. He has
your goods seized by force, making a fool out of you in public. Repairing the loss of
trust in this city will take a long time.

War in the HRE
The HRE, long angry with the Kingdom of France over control of certain contentious counties
along their border, has begun a small skirmish to sieze control of the counties. Inevitably
Empire-aligned cities will be expected to contribute in the near future, which will likely
translate to a tax on merchants such as yourself. It will likely consist of either 100 cash
or a large portion of wares if you lack enough cash.

City Elites on the Hunt
While setting up business for the day, you are approached by two men with a strong aura of authority.

FD 38 shows how the Council will frequently hold public meetings to announce and debate new statutes
and taxes. So, I wrote some events that let you try to influence these public meetings.
In general, you will need a higher reputation to be able to successfully influence the events.

Public Debate on Protectionism
There is a noticable crowd in the city today. Upon coming closer, you realize that the city council is
holding a public debate regarding trade.

Note: I love my stupid puns.
START
Event
An Olively Debate
You enter the city square. The debate seems to be over concerns of Genovese Olive Oil undercutting
the oil of local merchants and making the city too economically reliant on Genoa. Judging by the flow
of the debate at the moment, it seems likely that if you do nothing, a tax on Genovese olive oil will
occur soon in this city.
-You see yourself as important to this citys economy. Try to convince the crowd that the tax will scare you away.

Taxing Olive the Olives
As a merchant who deals in Genovese Olive Oil, you are approached by the Podesta. He examines

This is an alternate version of the above event chain that is identical but for Ferrarese fruit.
It occurs if you are in Genoa (since then the argument about protectionism makes no sense)
START
Event
A Fruitful Debate
You enter the Genovese square. The debate seems to be over concerns of Ferrarese fruit undercutting
the fruits of local merchants and making Genoa too economically reliant on Ferrara. Judging by the flow

occur soon in this city.

A Minor Debate
The town square appears abuzz with a public council debate. You listen in, and it is revealed that
the subject matter is how best to spend some excess tax money, whether on city defense or on fixing
part of a road. The subject matter given your tendency to travel is not relevant to you personally, but
by participating in this debate you could raise your reputation in the city.

Fundraising Debate
You arrive in the town square to see the council of the city holding a debate on whether to construct a
new well. A local mason claims he will do it for 100 Cash, but the city council is hesitant to spend the
money, and they attempt to steer the debate towards discussing a tax to fund the well. If you have the cash,
funding the well would surely raise your reputation, or alternatively you could just participate in the
debate to maybe get some face recognition and make some connections.

Letters to FD 82, 111, 113, 115 deal with how war occurs and how it impacts the local cities.
So, here are a few events that deal with that.
Chiefly, the threat of conflict tends to make families stockpile food as it becomes harder to find
when the conflict itself rages.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
START
RandomEvent
Conflict on the Horizon
After attending the latest Council meeting, you are made privy to an upcoming conflict between two
neighboring counts over some minor succession. Conflict breeds scarcity, so the local townsfolk is
beginning to barricade and stockpile their own belongings. Not everyone has enough grain to weather the
storm, so you could get away with selling your stock for even higher prices. Or, you could build connections
by granting money to townsfolk to raise your public image. Further still, if you aren't well known in town,
it may be wiser to focus on protecting your own assets, as you can't trust anyone to do it for you...

Peter Stufford's "Power and Profit" covers how Italian cities attempted to get notable members of the city

Summons from Pisa
You as a prominent merchant who began his career in Pisa have an obligation to spend some time there every
now and then to remain in the city's good graces. Or, at least, that's what this letter says from a servant
back in Pisa. The servant seems to be really implying that you should return home for next year, perhaps he
thinks the council of Pisa is getting antsy about people leaving their city to live in rival cities like
Florence.

This event inspired by mentions of Free Companies (effectively bandits) razing land and
creating disorder after the Plague struck in The Merchant of Prato by Origo, page 66. The

The Aftermath of Illness
You enter the town square for the first time in a month to find a huge state of disarray.
It seems in your absense you have avoided an outbreak of Slow Fever, but while the illness
is gone, bands of men known as the Free Companies have used the disorder to raid and
plunder the fields that sustain the city. There is a desperate need for grain in the city,
and now would be an excellent time to make this city indebted to you... or a fine opportunity
to spike your prices and exploit this desperate situation. You'll need at least 50 grain
to make any sort of impact here.

To maintain power, guild leaders can even have uncooperative merchants and craftsmen locally
excommunicated. This fact lingers in the back of your mind as you are approached by leaders of
one of the local guilds. If you are a foreigner and have a high reputation in the city, you shouldn't
expect this conversation to be pleasant.

as much as 200 "units" of wine and will pay far above market price. You decide that now is not the time
