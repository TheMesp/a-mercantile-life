~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
HOW TO READ THIS FILE:
Each event starts and ends with START and END.
The rough formatting is as follows (START and END
placed in brackets to avoid the program accidentally
reading this)
(the START word)
Event Type
Event Title
Event Description (can be multiple lines)
(The following fields are optional and can be omitted)
-Decision Title	
	#This decision will only be visible if this condition is true (there can be several of these)
	>Future Events Created by this decision>Months until the future event occurs
		(the future events can be seperated with the & symbol: in this case,
		the program will randomly choose one of the events listed.)
	Variables that are modified by this decision
-(additional decisions if required)
(the END word)

If an event has no decisions or no visible decisions, then the code will generate a generic
decision that will show as "1: Continue..." that has no effect. Essentially, the event is
just informative and has no immediate effect.

Only events with the type RandomEvent can be chosen randomly. All other events are generated
either directly in the code or are events that spawn from decisions. I try to keep child events nearby
their parent RandomEvent that can create them, if that makes sense.
CITY REFERENCE:
Cities are represented in the game CODE by a number (in gameplay, this is translated to the actual name).
The following number mapping is used:
0: Pisa
1: Genoa
2: Ferarra
3: Kaffa
4: Naples
5: Barcelona
6: Lubeck

VARIABLE GLOSSARY:
Plan	Special variable that decides whether to open the planning screen. Only used in YearlyEvents.
Cash	Amount of immediate cash.
IndCash	Amount of indirect cash via Bills of Exchange or other means.
City	A number representing the currently inhabited city.
SWares	Stands for "Specific Wares". After the event is calculated, the number in SWares is transferred
	to the ware that matches your current city.
0Wares	Current stock of wares in city 0 (Pisa). Similar for 1Wares through to 6Wares.
RWares	Special number that either grants or removes completely random wares.
	Adding random wares always adds the number.
	Removing random wares will try to reach the given number (since we don't want the code to crash
	trying to remove wares that aren't even there!)
TWares	Stands for "Total Wares" and is only used for checks. Represents the total stock of the player's wares.
0Rep...6Rep, SRep	Exact same concept as the "Wares" variables, but for Reputation.
CRep	Stands for "City Reputation". Always holds the current repuation of the city, and is used for checks.
Guelph/Ghibelline	Either 0 if not in a Guelph/Ghibelline city or 1 if in.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
These first two events are special events, created at the start of each year.
The first event only appears once, is the first event to occur, and forces you
to begin the planning interface. The second event that occurs every subsequent
January gives you a choice to just immediately remain and build reputation if
you want to save time by skipping the planning interface.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
START
YearlyEvent
Opening Moves
Shortly after inheriting your fathers money and wares, you
see it fit to use these assets to lay groundwork for a
successful mercantile career.
-Begin Planning!
	Plan = 1
END

START
YearlyEvent
The Start of Another Year
The sun rises on the beginning of another year. It is now
time to plan expenditures and actions for the following year.
-Begin Planning!
	Plan = 1
-Skip Planning
	Plan = 0
	SRep = 10
END

START
Event
Debug
Something went wrong! I tried to load an event that didn't exist. This event is a special
debug event so that the game doesn't crash and you can continue playing, but this really shouldn't be
here. Have exactly 1 Cash as my way of saying sorry.
-Take the free money
	Cash + 1

RandomEvent
An Emergency Need for Wine
You encounter a panicked man who you recognize as a council member of the city. As it turns out, he was
hosting a party, but one of his servants accidentally left the stock of wine uncovered for days and
spoiled it. He implores you to sell him some wine, claiming that he needs at least 50 but would prefer
as much as 200 "units" of wine and will pay far above market price. You decide that now is not the time
to pester him over what exactly a "unit" of wine is, and are confident that whoever needed to understand
that terminology understood it. Helping a council member like this will surely reflect nicely on you...
-Sell the host 50 wine for 200 cash. (+5 Rep)
	#4Wares > 49
	4Wares - 50
	Cash + 200
	SRep + 5
-Give the host 50 wine as a gesture of goodwill. (+15 Rep)
	#4Wares > 49
	4Wares - 50
	SRep + 15
-Sell the host 100 wine for 400 cash. (+10 Rep)
	#4Wares > 99
	4Wares - 100
	Cash + 400
	SRep + 10
-Give the host 100 wine as a gesture of goodwill. (+30 Rep)
	#4Wares > 99
	4Wares - 100
	SRep + 30
-Sell the host 200 wine for 800 cash. (+20 Rep)
	#4Wares > 199
	4Wares - 200
	Cash + 800
	SRep + 20
-Give the host 200 wine as a gesture of goodwill. (+60 Rep)
	#4Wares > 199
	4Wares - 200
	SRep + 60
-Apologize and move on.

These last two events are manually placed into the game by the code, giving you a 5 year warning to the end of the simulation
and the final event of the simulation itself.

START
Event
A Deadly Premonition
Something feels very ominious as you stand in the market today. You feel that if you have anything left to
do in your career, you should find time for it in the next 5 years.
-Duly noted.
END
START
Event
Death of a Salesman
The year is 1348, and illness beyond anything ever seen before has struck. Staying in one place seems like
the safest bet, but as a merchant doing so is almost impossible. You look back at your accomplishments in the
last 48 years, and reminisce on your successful career before you set sail for the last time.
-I hope the Church was right and I can buy my way into heaven!
